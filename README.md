1. Python language is used for the coding part. Python is one of the most popular
object-oriented, high-level programming languages. As it has a wide collection of
libraries(for example pandas, matplotlib, etc) that provide powerful and efficient tools
for data manipulation and analysis.
2. Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that enables users to create and
share documents with real-time code, equations, visuals, and text. It has an interactive
environment which makes it easy to apply different cleaning techniques and test the
code in real time.
3. Pandas is a famous library that is commonly used for data cleaning, data
manipulation, and data analysis. Pandas can significantly reduce the time and work
required to prepare data for analysis. Pandas supports data manipulation, which helps
in converting raw data into a more useful format. Pandas also helps in merging files
but the format of data is important in order to merge. In this project, we had to merge
the dataset of 1st quarter after applying the cleaning process on a it.

4.TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library that is commonly used for
building deep learning models. It helps in building complex models as it provides
high-level API for training neural networks, the LSTM model is defined using
TensorFlowâ€™s API, and the model is trained using its optimizer and MSE loss
function. It helps in applying deep learning networks and analyzing the
prediction[14].
2. StandardScaler is a class from the scikit-learn library that helped in the
standardization of input data and scaling it to have zero mean and unit variance. It
helped in the stability and convergence of the optimization algorithm[14].
